<p><em>Edit Mar 3 2012: The "anvil" branch has been merged into master. This post edited to reflect that.</em></p><p><em>Edit: Mar 1 2012, updated this post to reflect the new "anvil" branch.</em></p><p>In our efforts to rewrite the internals of The Overviewer, we have stripped overviewer.py of almost all its command line options and opted to require everything but the simplest renders into a new config file format. This post goes over the rationale and how to get started with the new format.</p><p><strong>Why?</strong></p><p>Before it was possible to run the Overviewer without a configuration file at all. Every option was on the command line, and the only thing you <em>needed</em>&#160;the config file for was custom rendermodes.</p><p>But as we were thinking about supporting multi-world, where a server may run many Minecraft worlds, we wanted Overviewer to handle options in a more general way. Some options may only apply to one render of one world, others may apply to all renders.</p><p>We briefly considered how to support this on a command line, perhaps with something like this:</p><pre>./overviewer.py --world=/path/world1 --opt=1 --world=/path/world2 --opt=2</pre><p>but this seems cumbersome and confusing. It seems obvious that a more structured method of configuring your renders is needed.</p><p><strong>The Config File</strong></p><p>So here's the solution we came up with. It lets you individually specify "renders", which is a rendering of a world with a set of options. You can specify multiple renders of a single world with different options, renders of different worlds, etc. We tried to leave it as customizable as possible.</p><p>The configuration file is, as before, parsed as a regular python file, meaning you can put any extra complicated logic you want in there. After it's parsed, it expects three things to be defined:</p><ul><li>a dictionary called "worlds" that maps world names to their paths on disk.</li><li>a dictionary called "renders" that maps render names to a dictionary of options.</li><li>a string called "outputdir" containing the path to the directory to place the output</li></ul><p>I have written up further details about the config file on the documentation site:&#160;<a href="http://docs.overviewer.org/en/latest/config/">http://docs.overviewer.org/en/latest/config/</a>. Head there and have a look over it to get an idea of what's possible. I don't want to repeat what's there, and I think that's a pretty good place to start.</p><p><strong>Converting your existing setup to a config file</strong></p><p>Most likely you have some setup where you run overviewer.py from a cron or on a schedule with a bunch of options. Let's say you're running this:</p><pre>overviewer.py -v --north-direction=upper-right --imgformat=jpg --rendermodes=smooth-lighting,smooth-night /path/to/myworld /path/to/mymap</pre><p>To migrate to the new branch, you should first create a config file. It can be named anything you want. If your editor has syntax highlighting, it will be helpful to give it the extension .py, but it's not necessary.</p><p>Say you create "myovconfig.py". This is what you'd add to that file to duplicate your setup:</p><pre>worlds["myworld"] = "/path/to/myworld"

renders["dayrender"] = {
        "world": "myworld",
        "title": "Daytime",
        "rendermode": smooth_lighting,
        "imgformat": "jpg",
        "northdirection": "upper-right",
        }

renders["nightrender"] = {
        "world": "myworld",
        "title": "Nighttime",
        "rendermode": smooth_night,
        "imgformat": "jpg",
        "northdirection": "upper-right",
        }

outputdir = "/path/to/mymap"</pre><p><em>Note: the 'world' option was named 'worldname' up until recently.</em></p><p>Then you run Overviewer with this command:</p><pre>overviewer.py --config=/path/to/myovconfig.py</pre><p>Yes, it is a bit more verbose, but you can see how it is much more customizable than before. You can change the options for the individual renders, add renders for other worlds, add additional renders for the same world (perhaps with a different north-direction!) It's up to you!</p><p>As always, join us in <a href="http://overviewer.org/irc/">IRC</a> if you have any questions!</p>

And now we need your help to test it out, and give us feedback!</p><div><p><strong>Why have we done this?</strong></p><p>You may be wondering why we took 2 months off from regular development to rewrite code that worked just fine. As some may have guessed, code that evolves over time tends to accumulate cruft and gets more and more difficult to work on as time goes by. Our code has been evolving for over a year now, and while it started out relatively clean, now it's not so much. As new features were added, the code strained to&#160;accommodate them. For example, the customizable north direction feature required adding a small "shim" at just about every layer of code, which is prone to cause problems because it adds complex dependencies between all layers of the program.</p><p>In short, the code was becoming increasingly difficult to work on, and more importantly, it was becoming less <em>fun</em>&#160;to work on. So we did what all programmers dream of doing but can't because of practical deadlines and such: re-designed most of the core components almost from scratch.</p><p>In this re-write we have completely re-thought the way all the internal components fit together and how they interact. The new interfaces between components are much cleaner and the clean separation of responsibility makes the code much easier to work on: easier to add new features, easier to fix bugs, easier to maintain.</p><p>Most of that is of no concern to end users though; people that just want to <em>use</em>&#160;Overviewer don't care how it works. Well, there's something for you too! Along with the rewrite we have many new features and potential features that were either impossible or prohibitively difficult before!</p><p><strong>Here's the new fun features:</strong></p><ul><li>Multi-world! Render and display all your worlds with one unified interface.</li><li>Along with that, Nether and The End support!</li><li>Fixed north-directions to the new sun direction. (Finally!)</li><li>Completely re-designed configuration file format, more customizability!</li><li>Per-render configuration options - render one world multiple ways, render all your worlds one way, or some complex combination. It's up to you!</li><li>Truly customizable rendermodes: compose your own rendermode from our built-in rendermode <em>primitives</em>.</li><li><em>New</em>: Anvil support</li><li><em>New:</em>&#160;Built-in Biome Support!</li></ul><p>Here's the new <em>potential</em>&#160;features -- features that are not in yet, but should be "easy" to implement with the new architecture (if there's demand for these features, they will get implemented!):</p><div><ul><li>Configurable, pluggable caches. Configure the memory usage or even offload your cache to memcached</li><li>Render-farm support: get an entire cluster of machines to render your worlds!</li><li>Support for rendering of smaller portions or subsets of your world, and even arbitrary world transformations (Render heights 0-32, cutting off everything else? Sure! Render your world upside down? I can't imagine why, but why not!)</li><li>More configurable logging</li></ul></div><p>We are releasing this as a "beta" at this point. The new branch is not complete yet. We still have these items to re-implement:</p><div><ul><li>points of interest (signs, etc)</li><li>Overlays</li><li>Miscellaneous&#160;options like textures-path, skip-js, web-assets, no-signs</li></ul></div><div><p>Additionally, it is not yet polished. For example, the output may contain lots of debug lines that got left in, any error messages may not be very friendly, and of course it may contain bugs.</p><p>But we feel like it's ready for people to try out. We're ready to start getting some feedback and some help on finding the last few bugs.</p><p><strong>If you would like to try it out, keep reading</strong>, but know that things may still change in backwards-incompatible ways. Remember that this is a "preview" and you'd be helping us test it. <strong>It's not <em>done</em>&#160;yet, but we feel that it's complete enough to start soliciting feedback.</strong></p></div><p>We're not building binary packages for the new branch at this time. If you would like to try it out, clone the repository and checkout the "anvil" branch:</p><blockquote><pre><span>git clone -b anvil git://github.com/overviewer/Minecraft-Overviewer.git</span></pre></blockquote><p>If you don't have git, you can also download a source tarball:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/overviewer/Minecraft-Overviewer/tarball/anvil">https://github.com/overviewer/Minecraft-Overviewer/tarball/anvil</a></p><div><p>I've rewritten the documentation to go over the new configuration file format.

<p>Thanks to those that have tried the new beta and given us feedback. We've already fixed several bugs; things are shaping up nicely!</p><p>About the new "Anvil" level format, we will be supporting this, but it is a rather hefty change. Our tentative plan is to make a new branch off of the beta "rewrite" branch for the anvil level format. Once the anvil format makes its way out of the Minecraft "pre-release" stage and into a proper release, we will merge the branch of our code and the new format will be the only one supported from then on.</p><p>We currently don't have any plans to support the Anvil format in the old "master" branch. We are not against it, but I don't&#160;foresee&#160;anyone stepping up to do the work. This means there is a deadline for those of you to convert your config files and setups to the new config format if you want to stay up to date. <em>We believe the new config format is not complicated enough to be a big barrier for converting. If you need help please see us in IRC!</em></p><p>We also currently don't have any plans to support both world formats in one code-base. The changes it requires are quite extensive and I don't see that as being a very feasible option. Thus, if you want to continue running an older version of Minecraft with the older level format in the future, you will be blocked from updating Overviewer past a certain point. We will probably end up leaving a Git branch or tag at the last commit that supports the old format for those that don't want to upgrade. However, as time goes on we think most everyone will end up updating (just like we did for the old chunk format when it upgraded to region files)</p><p>Again, this is our tentative plan. Things may still change depending on demand or who's willing to do what work or how difficult a task turns out to be.</p><p>As always, happy Overviewing!</p><p>-brownan</p>

For the last month or so, the Overviewer team has been working with him to render high-resolution maps of these worlds.</p><p>The two largest continents, Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor, are complete and <a href="http://overviewer.org/wow/" title="WoW map">are ready to view</a>. Other continents may also be made available as they are rendered.</p><p>The process of creating these worlds to begin with is difficult and extremely interesting, and you can learn about it in <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/997352-crafting-azeroth/" title="forum thread">this Minecraft Forum thread</a>. This blog post, though, will focus specifically on what we had to do to create this map.</p><h3>A Tall Order</h3><p>The first hurdle to overcome was the world height. Normal Minecraft worlds are 256 blocks high, but Kalimdor is 1408 blocks high. This means that Kalimdor is 5.5 times taller than normal Minecraft worlds, and 11 times taller than old Minecraft worlds (before the Anvil map format). Since normal Minecraft clients can't handle worlds this tall, RamsesA split the world up into 7 normal-height overlapping world layers, and used a Bukkit plugin to automatically teleport between the layers for a nearly seamless experience. This is great for exploring the map, but Overviewer expects all its map data in a single world. So, the first step was to turn these 7 layers back into a single mega-world with all 1408 blocks of height. To do this, I used my own <a href="https://github.com/agrif/libredstone" title="libredstone">libredstone</a>&#160;with python bindings.</p><p>Once all the world layers were merged, it was possible to load up the world in Overviewer. However, Overviewer still expected the world to be 256 blocks high, so it only rendered a tiny part of the world. Back after the Anvil change, when worlds doubled in height, brownan had worked out the changes needed to the render code. This change was so similar it was mostly a matter of changing a few constants. Our recent rewrite ensured that very few parts of Overviewer code actually depend on world height, and by the end of this process, it had been reduced to two source lines.</p><h3>Making it Pretty</h3><p>So now we were rendering, and boy was it something else. These worlds were <em>huge</em>&#160;and <em>beautiful</em>. We worked with RamsesA to come up with a combination of render primitives to best show off his work. Since there were a lot of forests with very large trees, a lot of the ground was too dark with the normal Overviewer lighting, so we settled on smooth lighting at 65% strength.</p><p>There were a few details left to work out about the rendering, though. RamsesA's conversion code placed water blocks in ways that Minecraft never does, causing a few minor errors in the render. Fixing these was just a few changes to the C source, and an since Overviewer is an incremental renderer, it was easy to just re-render the parts of the map that needed it. Having a render of the entire world also helped to find minor errors in the world itself, which were quickly corrected and fixed with more incremental renders. All told, it took about 2 - 3 weeks for all these renders to finish, running on the beefy 4-core machine hosting <a href="http://overviewer.org/" title="overviewer.org">overviewer.org</a>&#160;(graciously hosted by <a href="http://nexcess.net/" title="nexcess.net">nexcess.net</a>).</p><h3>Final Presentation</h3><p>Now that the bulk of the rendering was done, it was time for the finishing touches. Eminence and pironic assisted RamsesA in placing markers on the map, which showed location info and photos when clicked. This was mostly a matter of using Overviewer's built in POI code, with a few minor tweaks for using it to display so much information. A lot of the Overviewer team also helped with placing the markers and taking photos in-game to go along with them. Finally, Eminence made a few changes to the map controls to simplify the map interface, and a bunch of smaller ones to make the entire experience feel better.</p><p>One of the goals of the rewrite was to make large changes like this easy, and I think the success of this project is a sign that we succeeded. Now that we're done, the improvements and changes made for this project will trickle back into the official Overviewer source as soon as we clean them up and make them configurable. As a bonus, RamsesA found a wonderful optimization in our code that should speed up render times by as much as 15%.</p><p>All together, this was a massive and fun project for us. It was great working with RamsesA to stretch the limits of what Overviewer can do, and we hope you like the result.</p><p>(<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/wl5li/a_google_maps_view_of_azeroth_in_minecraft/" title="reddit thread">Reddit thread</a>)</p>

<p>For the last few months, I've been working on a replacement for <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/" title="PIL">PIL</a> to use with Overviewer. PIL is nice for simple imaging tasks, but as Overviewer grew we were constantly hitting annoying limitations or performance issues. Over time we've accumulated a bunch of ad-hoc image manipulation code, and we decided to consolidate it all and finally replace the parts of PIL we still used. The result is <a href="http://github.com/overviewer/OIL/" title="OIL">OIL</a>&#160;(Overviewer Imaging Library), which is now very close to being finished.</p><p>Along the way, I decided to also rewrite Overviewer's renderer. Currently, Overviewer renders a world by pre-rendering a bunch of block sprites, then pasting those sprites onto the final images. This has worked well, but adding new blocks is an extremely tedious process of manipulating pixels directly to produce something that looks 3D. It also has a major drawback: the view angle and block size is fixed. We've been asked many times to allow configurable block sizes or map rotations, and we haven't been able to do these because our current renderer design is not flexible enough.</p><p>The new renderer is based entirely around 3D block meshes. It draws these directly to the final images, meaning it's trivially easy to rotate and scale them exactly how you want. Overall this means more flexibility for you in how you render your maps, and easier to maintain code for us: adding new blocks is as simple as creating a new block mesh.</p><p>Now, there are two main concerns I want to address as soon as possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Won't this new renderer be slower? It sounds much more complicated.</strong></p>
<p>Wonderfully, <em>no!</em> The current experimental renderer currently runs 5% to 15% <em>faster</em> than our old sprite-based renderer. There are still blocks and features to add, but I don't expect it to get much slower from here. At the very least, the new renderer will run in about the same time as the old renderer.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>3D? I don't like needing a video card just to render maps.</strong></p>
<p>The new experimental renderer is entirely CPU-based. You don't need
a video card, and you don't need a graphical environment. If you
were able to run Overviewer before, you'll still be able to. In
particular, for Unix users, <em>you will not need X to run
Overviewer</em>.</p>
<p>For those of you who have a video card and would like to use it,
OIL has an OpenGL backend that currently renders 15% to 25% faster
than the old renderer; but this is an option, not a requirement!</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>So, that's what's been going on for the last few months. The rest of this post is dedicated to pictures, but as always, if you have any comments or questions we would love to hear from you <a href="http://overviewer.org/irc" title="#overviewer on freenode">either in IRC</a> or <a href="http://github.com/overviewer/Minecraft-Overviewer/issues" title="GitHub Issues">on GitHub</a>.</p><h2>Cool Features and Pretty Pictures</h2><p>I'm going to be putting a lot of images below. You can click on them to get the full-sized versions.</p>

<h3>Renderer</h3>
<p>First, two shots of the same area, one with the current renderer and
one with the experimental renderer:</p>
<p><a href="/~agrif/oilblog/old.png"><img src="/~agrif/oilblog/oldthumb.png" /></a>
<a href="/~agrif/oilblog/cpu.png"><img src="/~agrif/oilblog/cputhumb.png" /></a></p>
<p>Please remember that the experimental renderer is still unfinished;
there are a lot of missing blocks, and biome coloring hasn't been
implemented yet. These are just a preview of what's coming.</p>
<p>The first picture (with the old renderer) took 1.37 seconds, while the
second (new renderer) took only 1.14.</p>
<p>Just for fun, here's a picture of the same area, rendered on my GPU
with OpenGL:</p>
<p><a href="/~agrif/oilblog/opengl.png"><img src="/~agrif/oilblog/openglthumb.png" /></a></p>
<p>It's almost identical to the CPU-rendered version, and this one
rendered in 1.04 seconds.</p>
<h3>Configurable Views</h3>
<p>The advantages of the new renderer don't really show themselves in side-by-side comparisons though. How about something the old renderer couldn't do?</p>
<p>What if you wanted to render your map with <em>huge</em> blocks, at a really weird angle? I don't know why you'd want to, but with the new renderer, you can:</p>
<p><a href="/~agrif/oilblog/weird.png"><img src="/~agrif/oilblog/weirdthumb.png" /></a></p>
<h3>Dithering</h3>
<p>One benefit we'll be getting from OIL is much more subtle than the new
renderer. Consider these two images:</p>
<p><a href="/~agrif/oilblog/undithered.png"><img src="/~agrif/oilblog/unditheredthumb.png" /></a>
<a href="/~agrif/oilblog/dithered.png"><img src="/~agrif/oilblog/ditheredthumb.png" /></a></p>
<p>They look about the same, right? Well, would you believe the one on
the right is <em>80% smaller?</em> That's because the one on the right is an
<em>indexed image</em>, meaning it uses only 256 total colors instead of the
4 billion colors normal Overviewer images use. Overviewer images look
really good as indexed images, because Minecraft doesn't really use a
whole lot of distinct colors.</p>
<p>While PIL has support for indexed images, it has no support for
<em>transparent</em> indexed images, which made implementing this
impossible. OIL has no such restriction.</p>
<h2>When will we see it?</h2>
<p>While OIL itself is just about done, the new renderer still needs a
lot of work before it'll be merged. This blog post is just to let you
know that Overviewer isn't dead -- in fact, far from it. There are
exciting things in the future.</p>

body = '''
<p>Hi, I'm CounterPillow. If you've ever been in our IRC channel, you've
probably seen me. I have been an irregular contributor to Overviewer
for some time now, and recently, I've rewritten the way <em>optimizeimg</em>
works. I thought that this would be a good opportunity to explain what
it is, and how to best use it.</p>
<p>First, let's explain what this is all about. In essence, this
increases the time it takes to render a map in favor of smaller
images. But how does it do that? <em>optimizeimg</em> allows you to run
various image optimizers against each tile image the Overviewer
outputs. As of the time of writing, we support optipng, pngcrush and
pngnq.</p>
<h2>Lossless vs. Lossy Compression</h2>
<p>One of the key things to understand is what lossless and lossy
compression mean. In lossless compression, the file size is reduced,
but the decompressed data is exactly the same. No data is lost in the
compression step, hence the name "lossless". Lossy compression, on the
other hand, does not preserve all information. An uncompressed output
of a lossy compression algorithm is not the same as the input.</p>
<p>As you may already know, PNG uses lossless compression. However, there
are a lot of different knobs to tweak when it comes to how the image
is compressed, thus reducing file size without altering the image
data, and we can even reduce the amount of colors in the image,
essentially making the process lossy! I'm not going to go into detail
as to how this all works in practice, but I will showcase the tools we
currently support to achieve this.</p>
<h2>Lossless Image Optimization, and "crushing"</h2>
<p>First off, I'll have to admit that I've lied in the previous
section. Some of the lossless image recompression methods are not
lossless in the sense of "data in is the same as data out
decompressed". Some tools, like optipng, discard unused alpha channels
(where images store their transparency), to reduce file size. I said
unused, which means that the visible output is still pixel-per-pixel
the same, thus lossless, but the image data is obviously
different. However, for all intents and purposes, we can call this
process "lossless", because no visible information has been changed.</p>
<p>Discarding unused alpha channels is one way of making the image
smaller, but there are other ways which are truly lossless. Both
pngcrush and optipng tweak the previously mentioned knobs of the
compression, trying to find the smallest possible output. The two
tools do this a bit differently, but the principle is the same: Tweak
the encoding parameters. This is what the Overviewer code refers to as
a "crusher". If you wish to learn more on how this is done internally,
you can read about it
<a href="http://optipng.sourceforge.net/pngtech/optipng.html">on the optipng site</a>,
but beware: It's quite technical.</p>
<h2>Lossy Image Optimization</h2>
<p>With pngnq, we also offer a way of lossy image optimization. You may
be wondering how a PNG can be lossily optimized, as the compression
method is lossless. The answer is simple: The amount of colors.</p>
<p>PNG supports a ton of different color modes, amongst them is an
indexed color mode, or also referred to as "Palette PNG" or
"PNG8". In images with indexed color modes, the colors of each pixel
aren't determined individually using red, green and blue
channels. Instead, it has a palette of colors, and then specifies for
each pixel the color for it by assigning it the a color of the
palette. This means less colors, in our case 256 at most, and because
we can represent those with just one byte, it means less data that
needs to be compressed. If we find the 256 colors that can best
represent the image, we get pretty good results that are just a
fraction of the original size; and since Minecraft doesn't use a lot
of colors in the default texture pack, it's barely noticeable. agrif
briefly mentioned this in the
<a href="http://overviewer.org/blog/2012/12/30/introducing-oil/">"Introducing OIL"</a>
blog post. In fact, if our input image has less than or exactly 256
colors anyway, the process is completely lossless!</p>
<p>Instead of waiting for OIL, you can use palette PNGs right now, with
the pngnq tool. However, please be aware that due to multiple bugs in
the imaging library we currently use, PIL (or Pillow, both are buggy),
this will break transparency. As stated in the docs, this is not
pngnq's fault.</p>
<h1>Using Image Optimization In Practice</h1>
<p>But how is this used in practice, you ask? It's not that hard. The
first step is to install the tools you wish to use and make sure they
can be called by Overviewer (i.e., are in your PATH environment
variable). Then, add them to your config.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware that this will increase render times.</strong></p>
<h2>An example for everyone</h2>
<p>The following example should be satisfactory for most people who wish
to use image optimization. Please also be aware that when I say "most
people", I always actually mean "most people". If you think you are
not "most people", then you're doing so carrying the risk that you may
be wasting your time.</p>

    <span class="s">"optimizeimg"</span><span class="p">:[</span><span class="n">optipng</span><span class="p">()],</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This will run optipng with the default number of trials (which is the
way to go for <em>most people</em>).</p>
<h2>Playing around with optimization levels</h2>
<p>We can, of course, also specify some parameters for optipng. Please
note that you're dangerously venturing out of <em>most people</em>-territory
here.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">optimizeimages</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">optipng</span>

<span class="n">renders</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"foo"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c"># ... other stuff here</span>
    <span class="s">"optimizeimg"</span><span class="p">:[</span><span class="n">optipng</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">olevel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)],</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This will essentially execute optipng -o3 (instead of -o2), you can
see what the exact meaning of that is in the optipng manual, or by
typing <code>optipng -h</code>. Please note that anything above, or most likely
even including the fifth optimization level, is pointless. The OptiPNG
developers
<a href="http://optipng.sourceforge.net/pngtech/optipng.html">said so themselves</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important to mention that the achieved compression ratio is
less and less likely to improve when higher-level presets
(trigerring more trials) are being used. Even if the program is
capable of searching automatically over more than 200 configurations
(and the advanced users have access to more than 1000
configurations!), a preset that selects around 10 trials should be
satisfactory for most users. Furthermore, a preset that selects
between 30-40 trials should be satisfactory for all users, for it is
very, very unlikely to be beaten significantly by any wider
search. The rest of the trial configurations are offered rather as a
curiosity (but they were used in the experimentation from which we
concluded they are indeed useless!)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Getting crazy</h2>
<p>Let's move on to something more hardcore, then. Let's say you don't
care if your map looks a bit weird thanks to PIL. Let's say you want
to use pngnq.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">optimizeimages</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">optipng</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">pngnq</span>

<span class="n">renders</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"foo"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c"># ... other stuff here</span>
    <span class="s">"optimizeimg"</span><span class="p">:[</span><span class="n">pngnq</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">optipng</span><span class="p">()],</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note the order in which the two optimizers are specified. Here, pngnq
is run first, then optipng is run on it. This is important: If you
feed crushed output into something that is not a crusher (i.e. does
not do lossless compression tweaking), all benefits of the crusher
will be lost; essentially, you'd be wasting your time. If you choose
to use more than one optimization tool, make sure the crusher is at
the end. Overviewer will warn you if it isn't.</p>
<h2>Don't be silly</h2>
<p>Speaking of more than one optimization tool, let's answer a very
important question: Will the image be smaller by using multiple
crushers chained together? (i.e. optipng after pngcrush)</p>
<p>The short answer: No.</p>
<p>The long answer: Most likely not.</p>
<p>Crushers, by default, exit if they fail to make the image smaller, and
just admit that they have not been able to crush it. Crushers may
perform differently in different situations, so using two crushers
chained after each other gives you essentially the best output of
either; however, for most images (and I say "most images" like I say
"most people"), this will be optipng in our example. Every
<em>optimizeimg</em> configuration that uses both pngcrush and optipng can
most likely be reduced to just optipng, with exactly the same results
but much faster renders.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>As you may have noticed, I often used "most likely" and "most people"
in this post. This is because we can't make certain statements without
large-scale tests, which I have not done,
<a href="http://css-ig.net/png-tools-overview.html">but other people did</a>. If
you're interested in utilizing image optimization, what you should
take away from this blog post is that <code>[optipng()]</code> is the way to
go. If you're not sure, do tests yourself. We may add support for
better image optimizers in the future, including some for JPEG, so
frequently checking the documentation to see which are available is a
good idea.</p>
